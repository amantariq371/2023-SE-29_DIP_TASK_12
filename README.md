Image Thresholding & Segmentation (Task 12)

This Python program performs image thresholding and segmentation on a user-uploaded image. It demonstrates multiple thresholding techniques including global thresholding, Otsu's method, and adaptive thresholding. For segmentation, it applies K-Means clustering with different cluster numbers (k=2,3,4) and Mean Shift filtering to separate regions based on color and intensity. The program displays the original image, thresholded results, and segmented outputs side by side for visual comparison, allowing users to analyze the effectiveness of different techniques.

Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, Google Colab files
